New Reg I-E revokes and replaces the previous framework under IDX Board of Directors Decree No. Kep-00066/BEI/09-2022 on the same subject (“**Previous Reg I-E**”), and is issued to align with the current provisions on share ownership reporting and to provide additional time for the submission of certain interim financial reports for listed insurance companies or insurance holding companies.
This legal update will outline the provisions introduced under New Reg I-E and their implication for listed companies and other relevant stakeholders.`,
                article_content: `
-   **_Share Ownership and Share Pledge Reporting_**

While New Reg I-E restates the entirety of the provisions under Previous Reg I-E, it removes Provision III.2.1.3 of the Previous Reg I-E concerning share ownership reporting, as the underlying regulatory reference in the previous framework is no longer applicable. Under New Reg I-E, the reporting mechanism for share ownership and any changes thereto in public companies must be conducted in accordance with the latest regulatory framework, namely the Financial Services Authority (_Otoritas Jasa Keuangan_  or “**OJK**”) Circular Letter No. 10/SEOJK.04/2025 on Electronic Submission of Ownership Reports or Any Changes in Share Ownership of Public Companies and Reports on the Pledging of Public Company Shares dated 5 June 2025 (“**SEOJK 10/2025**”).

As context, SEOJK 10/2025, which took effect on 5 December 2025, governs the submission of share ownership and share pledge reports to OJK, as mandated under OJK Regulation No. 4 of 2024 on Report of Ownership or Any Changes in Share Ownership of a Public Company and Report of Share Pledging Activities of a Public Company, through the electronic system managed by the Indonesian Central Securities Depository (_Kustodian Sentral Efek Indonesia_).

-   **_Relaxed Submission Deadline for Q3 Financial Statements of Listed Insurance Companies or Insurance Holding Companies_**

Pursuant to OJK Regulation No. 22 of 2024 on Periodic Reports of Insurance Companies, interim financial statements are generally required to be submitted to OJK no later than one month after the end of the relevant quarter, regardless of whether such financial statements are accompanied by a public accountant’s report. New Reg I-E has relaxed the deadline for the submission of third-quarter 2025 financial statements by listed insurance companies or insurance holding companies, as follows:

-   by the end of the third month after the financial statements date, if accompanied by a public accountant’s report in the form of an audit;
-   by the end of the second month after the financial statements date, if accompanied by a public accountant’s report in the form of a limited review; or
-   within 45 days after the financial statements date, if not accompanied by a public accountant’s report.`,

                article_background: `
On 14 November 2025, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (“**MEMR**”) issued Regulation No. 18 of 2025 (“**MR 18/2025**”) on the Implementing Regulation of Government Regulation No. 39 of 2025 (“**GR 39/2025**”), which lastly amends Government Regulation No. 96 of 2021 on the Implementation of Mineral and Coal Mining Business Activities. For further analysis of GR 39/2025, please refer to our publication linked  [here](https://ditralaw.com/indonesias-new-mining-framework-key-insights-into-government-regulation-no-39-of-2025-on-mineral-and-coal-business-activities/).

MR 18/2025, which took effect on 18 November 2025, seeks to provide clear implementing rules on several provisions introduced under GR 39/2025 and introduces substantive updates aimed to tighten, refine and enhance the regulatory framework for mineral and coal business activities, while strengthening compliance standards.

This legal update highlights the key updates introduced under MR 18/2025 that impact business actors in the mineral and coal mining industry, particularly with respect to administrative procedures, compliance and ongoing operational requirements.`,
                article_content: `
-   **_Revised Participants Eligibility Criteria for WIUP Auctions_**

MR 18/2025 revises the eligibility framework for Mining Business Permit Area (_Wilayah Izin Usaha Pertambangan_  or “**WIUP**”) auctions for metal minerals and coal concessions, replacing the previous regime set out under MEMR Regulation No. 7 of 2020 on Procedures for the Granting of Areas, Licensing and Reporting in Mineral and Coal Mining Business Activities (“**MR 7/2020**”). Under MR 7/2020, all wholly national private enterprises (irrespective of their business scale) were eligible to participate in such WIUP auction of any size. MR 18/2025 introduces a categorized set of criteria for such enterprises where:

1.  WIUP of up to 500 ha is now limited to wholly national private enterprises classified as micro or small businesses domiciled within the same province as the WIUP.
2.  WIUP larger than 500 ha is restricted to wholly national private enterprises classified as medium or large businesses.

In addition, MR 18/2025 no longer allows individuals, limited partnerships or general partnerships to participate in auctions for WIUP for either size category.

-   **_New Requirements for New Priority Right Holders_**

MR 18/2025 introduces new requirements for parties that have received a priority right (_pemberian prioritas_) over WIUP for metal minerals and coal concessions. These parties must now satisfy the following key requirements:

1.  settle the data-information compensation payment in a prescribed amount within seven business days of receiving the approval;
2.  procure the exploration surety bond in a prescribed amount in the form of a term deposit within the same seven-day period; and
3.  apply for the exploration-stage Mining Business License (_Izin Usaha Pertambangan_  or “**IUP**”) within ten business days of receiving the approval.

Failing that, the relevant party will be considered to have withdrawn from the granted priority rights, and the priority right approval will be revoked. Moreover, the relevant party and its affiliates will be blacklisted and prohibited from accessing licensing services for five years.

-   **_Additional Criteria for Extension of Exploration IUP and IUPK Validity_**

In addition to the criteria previously set out under GR 39/2025, MR 18/2025 introduces additional criteria under which holders of exploration IUP and Special Mining Business Licenses (_Izin Usaha Pertambangan Khusus_  or “**IUPK**”) may request an extension, namely:

1.  the extension is required to facilitate the settlement of outstanding non-tax state revenue obligations;
2.  exploration equipment has already been mobilized to the mining area; and/or
3.  the extension is required to support the development of mining-related facilities and supporting infrastructure, including those required for exploration activities.

-   **_Clarified Compensation Amount for WIUP Assigned Entities_**

MR 18/2025 reaffirms the provision under Government Regulation No. 25 of 2023 on Mining Area that business entities assigned by the Government to prepare a WIUP for coal and metal mineral concession retain the right to match the highest bid in the relevant auction of WIUP for that area.

Importantly, MR 18/2025 now addresses the compensation formula for when the assigned entities do not win the relevant WIUP auction. In such cases, the winning bidder must reimburse 75% of the actual realized exploration preparation costs incurred by the assigned business entity.

-   **_Further Detail for Radioactive Mineral and Rare Earth Metal WIUP_**

MR 18/2025 provides further detail on the allocation of radioactive mineral and rare earth metal WIUP under GR 39/2025, where it now outlines the procedural steps for WIUP designation and introduces eligibility thresholds for entities permitted to conduct exploitation and downstream activities.

Notably, MR 18/2025 only allows State Owned Enterprises (“**SOEs**”) to be the operator for radioactive mineral exploitation, thereby centralizing state control over these resources.

-   **_Revised WIUPK Offering and Joint Venture Requirements_**

MR 18/2025 revises the legal framework for simultaneous offerings of WIUPK for metal minerals and coal to SOE and Regional-Owned Enterprise (“**BUMD**”) under MR 7/2020 and the relevant MEMR decree. Key changes include:

1.  the timeframe for SOE or BUMD to submit their intent is extended from 14 calendar days to 15 business days from the offer;
2.  if there is more than one interested party, the agreement to establish a joint venture between the SOE and BUMD must now be submitted to the MEMR within 30 calendar days, shortened from the previous 60-day requirement; and
3.  joint ventures established by SOE and BUMD may involve third parties, provided that the SOE and BUMD collectively hold at least 75% equity ownership.

-   **_Priority Sequencing for Metal Mineral and Coal IUP over Non-Metal and Rock WIUP_**

MR 18/2025 establishes a clearer permitting hierarchy to address overlapping issues. Under the new framework, WIUP for non-metal and rock concessions cannot be granted in WIUP areas already designated for metal minerals or coal, or where an application for a metal mineral or coal IUP is still being processed.

In such circumstances, the MEMR or the relevant Governor may only grant WIUP for non-metal and rock in the same area after the issuance of the metal mineral or coal IUP for the relevant area.

-   **_Broaden Requirements for Production Operation IUP or IUPK Consolidation_**

GR 39/2025 established the general rule for consolidating multiple production operation IUPs, provided they cover the same commodity and are at the same activity stage.

MR 18/2025 also now allows a production operation IUP holder to consolidate its multiple production operation IUPs or IUPKs and further strengthens this framework by introducing an additional requirement that all permit areas must be located within a single, contiguous and adjoining block.

MR 18/2025 also provides clarity to the consolidation process. Consolidation application must be submitted to the MEMR and are now subject to defined maximum area thresholds, and the validity of the consolidated permits will follow the shortest remaining term among the permits being merged.

-   **_Expanded Pathways for IUP or IUPK Consolidation_**

MR 18/2025 also expands the consolidation framework beyond production-operation stage permits and single-entity holdings. Consolidation may now be initiated not only by the license holders, but also by regional governments or ministries/agencies.

Such consolidation is not limited to production-operation stage permits but is subject to five substantive criteria, namely (i) they must sit within a single, contiguous block, (ii) involve the same commodity, (iii) they are at the same activity stage, (iv) be held under the same business entity or its affiliate and (v) involve a merger.

The validity of the consolidated IUP or IUPK may follow either the longest remaining term among the permits or the timeframe required to complete the applicable value-added or downstreaming program.

-   **_Overlap Resolution Mechanism for Cross-Commodity IUP and SIPB Areas_**

MR 18/2025 introduces more detailed resolutions for resolving overlapping areas between non-metal mineral IUP, rock IUP or Rock Mining Permit (_Surat Izin Penambangan Batuan_  or “**SIPB**”) and metal mineral or coal IUP. MR 18/2025 sets out three frameworks:

1.  If a non-metal mineral IUP, rock IUP or SIPB overlaps with a metal mineral or coal IUP and the former fails to secure consent from the metal mineral or coal IUP holder, the non-metal mineral IUP, rock IUP, or SIPB will be revoked. Alternatively, the overlapping portion of the WIUP will be relinquished and returned to the state.
2.  If the non-metal mineral, specific non-metal mineral, rock IUP or SIPB predates the metal-mineral or coal IUP, the earlier permit holder (i) may continue operating until expiry but cannot extend the permit and (ii) must not mine any metal minerals or coal. Any inadvertently excavated material must be transferred to the adjacent metal/coal IUP holder.
3.  If cross-commodity overlap occurs and the metal mineral or coal IUP holder consents to non-metal mineral or rock operations, a new WIUP may be issued to either an affiliate of the metal mineral or coal IUP holder or another business entity approved by that holder.

-   **_Applicable Maximum Area Thresholds for IPR_**

MR 18/2025 now sets definitive thresholds on the maximum area of People’s Mining Permit (_Izin Pertambangan Rakyat_  or “**IPR**”). The relevant Governor may only grant IPR covering up to 5 hectares for individuals and up to 10 hectares for Cooperatives.

-   **_Transitional Provisions_**

To ensure legal certainty and continuity during the regulatory transition period, MR 18/2025 includes several key transitional provisions as follows:

-   Applications of WIUP for non-metal minerals and rock must be applied through OSS, with full implementation no later than six months after the enactment of MR 18/2025.
-   WIUP and WIUPK designated before MR 18/2025 came into force may be awarded either through an auction or through the priority rights mechanism in accordance with the procedures and requirements under MR 18/2025.

Applications for the approval of People’s Mining Area (_Wilayah Pertambangan Rakyat_) management documents that were already in process prior to enactment must be reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the new standards under MR 18/2025.`,
                article_conclusion: `MR 18/2025 provides comprehensive changes and clearer guidance to the mineral and coal mining legal framework, recalibrating rules and closing structural gaps left by prior regulations. The changes tighten eligibility parameters, reinforce commodity prioritization, and introduce compliance obligations that raise the operational standards for all industry participants.

The regulation also brings clarifications to areas with regulatory ambiguity. Spatial requirements for consolidation and overlap management are now codified, reducing discretion and creating anticipated pathways for resolving cross-commodity overlap issues. New mechanisms for WIUP and WIUPK allocation, whether through priority rights, auctions or SOE-led offerings, create a more accountable licensing landscape supported by defined timelines and differentiated eligibility thresholds.

MR 18/2025 also streamlines multi-permit management and accelerates decision timelines. By establishing explicit rules for extensions, consolidations, joint-venture structuring, and area limits, the regulation underscores a proactive commitment to disciplined, integrated and compliance-driven sector oversight, requiring business actors to proactively align their licensing and operational strategies with the new regime.`,

                article_background: `On 6 October 2025, the Indonesian Government enacted Law No. 16 of 2025 on the Fourth Amendment to Law No. 19 of 2003 on State-Owned Enterprises (“**Law 16/2025**”). The enactment of Law 16/2025 reflects the Government’s continuing effort to strengthen the governance and efficiency of state-owned enterprises (“**SOEs**”) as key contributors to Indonesia’s economic growth.

Since the issuance of Law No. 19 of 2003 on State-Owned Enterprises, the legal framework on SOEs has undergone multiple revisions to align with evolving market dynamics, corporate governance standards and state priorities. Law 16/2025 introduces further structural, governance and operational refinements. It reinforces the separation between the Government’s regulatory and management functions and harmonize SOEs governance with international best practices.

This legal update will outline the key changes introduced under Law 16/2025 and their implications for SOEs, government institutions and stakeholders engaging with state enterprises.`,
                article_content: `
-   **_Transformation of Ministry of SOE into BP BUMN_**

Law 16/2025 mandates the President of the Republic of Indonesia (“**President**”) to establish the SOE Regulatory Agency (_Badan Pengaturan Badan Usaha Milik Negara_  or “**BP BUMN**”). Upon its establishment, the Ministry of SOE shall be dissolved, its personnel transferred to BP BUMN and all SOE shares currently registered under the name of the Minister of SOE transferred to BP BUMN as the new legal shareholder.

Furthermore, the Head of BP BUMN, appointed by the President, shall assume the institutional role previously held by the Minister of SOE and retains an equivalent ministerial status. In this capacity, Head of BP BUMN shall serve as the principal regulator responsible for the formulation, supervision and coordination of state policies on the management of SOEs.

Following this transformation, the ownership and control of Series A Dwiwarna shares, previously vested to the Minister of SOE, shall be exercised by the Head of BP BUMN. Consequently, all rights, approvals and supervisory authorities formerly conferred upon the Minister of SOE under applicable laws, regulations and corporate governance instruments will now fall under the authority of BP BUMN, unless expressly regulated otherwise under Law 16/2025. Such exceptions and their implications are further discussed in the following sections of this update.

-   **_Changes to SOE Shareholding Structure_**

Law 16/2025 amends the provisions related to the State of the Republic of Indonesia (“**State**”) share ownership in SOEs. Previously, the law merely required the State to hold Series  _A Dwiwarna_  share in each SOE through the Minister of SOE. Under Law 16/2025, the ownership requirement is more detailed where State’s shareholding in the SOE shall comprise of 1% Series  _A Dwiwarna_  shares held through BP BUMN, and 99% Series B shares held through Daya Anagata Nusantara Investment Management Agency (_Badan Pengelola Investasi Daya Anagata Nusantara_  or “**BPI Danantara**”).

This new shareholding structure appears to be inconsistent with the current SOE’s shareholding structure, where typically (i) only one Series  _A Dwiwarna_  share is issued, which may be below the required 1% threshold and (ii) Series B shares are generally held by the Operational Holding Entity, rather than BPI Danantara. On the latter, Law 16/2025 does not clarify whether the Series B shares must be held directly by BPI Danantara or may continue to be structured through the Operational Holding Company, as is current practice.

The amendment also raises challenges for SOEs whose shares are also held by non-State parties, such as publicly listed SOEs, since a strict reading of the relevant provision suggests that all SOEs shares must be held by the State.

This lack of clarity creates uncertainty in the implementation, and further guidance or implementing regulations will be essential to ensure consistent interpretation and application across the SOEs landscape. Subject to such implementing regulations and guidance, the State may need to adjust the composition of Series A  _Dwiwarna_  and Series B shares across SOEs to align with the ownership ratio introduced under Law 16/2025.

-   **_Amendment to BP BUMN Authorities_**

With the transformation of the Ministry of SOE into BP BUMN, all authorities previously held by the Minister of SOE are generally transferred to the Head of BP BUMN. However, Law 16/2025 introduces several changes to these authorities and responsibilities previously vested in the Ministry SOE, resulting in a clearer separation between regulatory oversight and policy direction.

Certain authorities that no longer fall within BP BUMN’s mandate are now assigned to BPI Danantara, including (i) approval of SOEs restructuring plans, such as mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and spin-offs, as well as write-off and debt forgiveness matters and (ii) issuance of strategic guidelines or policies in areas such as finance, development and investment.

Typically, authority to issue strategic guidelines or policies is expressly provided in the SOE’s articles of association as part of the Series A  _Dwiwarna_  shareholder’s special rights. Where applicable, SOEs are expected to amend their articles of association to remove such authority from the right of Series A  _Dwiwarna_  shareholder to ensure consistency with Law 16/2025.

-   **_Changes to Operational and Investment Holding Companies’ Shareholding Structure_**

Previously, the Minister of SOE held the Series A  _Dwiwarna_  share in the Investment and Operational Holding Companies. Under Law 16/2025, the Ministry of SOE (or, as currently constituted, BP BUMN) shall no longer hold any shares in these companies. Instead, BPI Danantara shall hold all shares in both companies.

To comply with this new ownership structure requirement, both Investment and Operational Holding Companies must adjust their shareholding composition by 6 January 2026.

-   **_BP BUMN Now Entitled to Manage SOEs Dividend_**

Generally, the right to receive and manage SOEs dividends lies with BPI Danantara and the Investment Holding Company. However, Law 16/2025 now provides flexibility by allowing BP BUMN to manage such dividend, subject to the President’s approval.

-   **_Foreign Citizen Now Permitted to Serve as SOE Director_**

Law 16/2025 now permits foreign citizens to serve as Directors of SOEs, provided they satisfy the prescribed eligibility criteria and obtain prior approval from BP BUMN.

-   **_Restriction on Ministers and Vice Ministers to hold Structural Roles in SOEs_**

Law 16/2025 reaffirms the restriction prohibiting members of the Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners of SOEs from concurrently serving as the Minister or Vice Minister of the Republic of Indonesia. This clarification aligns with Article 23 of Law No. 39 of 2008 on State Ministries (as amended) and Constitutional Court Decision No. 128/PUU-XXIII/2025, which collectively stipulate that both the Minister and Vice Minister of the Republic of Indonesia are prohibited from concurrently serving as members of any SOE’s Board of Directors or Board of Commissioners.

-   **_Status of SOE and BPI Danantara Personnels_**

Law 16/2025 now provides that the members of any SOE’s Board of Directors, Board of Commissioners, and employees of SOEs, as well as organs and employees of BPI Danantara are now explicitly subject to statutory provisions governing good governance and sound business practices. Previously, these personnels were not explicitly classified as state administrators and therefore were arguably not bound by regulations applicable to public officials, for example Law No. 28 of 1999 on State Administrators Who Are Clean and Free from Corruption, Collusion and Nepotism (as partially repealed by Law No. 30 of 2002 on the Corruption Eradication Commission).

Following this change, such personnels are deemed to fall within the scope of legislation applicable to state administrators, including subjecting them to the governance and integrity obligations set out under Law No. 28 of 1999.

-   **_Expanded Authority of BPK over SOEs_**

Previously, BPK’s mandate was limited to conducting special-purpose audits of SOEs upon request from the Indonesia’s House of Representatives, and only in relation to government fund utilization (e.g., state capital injections). Law 16/2025 expands this authority, enabling BPK to audit SOEs more broadly, provided such audits comply with applicable laws and regulations.

-   **_Transitional Provisions_**

To ensure legal continuity and a seamless transition to the new framework, Law 16/2025 sets out several transitional provisions, including:

1.  Existing assignments issued by the Minister of SOEs or relevant technical ministers prior to the enactment of the Law 16/2025 shall remain valid until the end of their respective terms.
2.  All references to the Minister of SOEs in existing regulations and official documents shall be construed as referring to the Head of BP BUMN.
3.  Until BP BUMN is formally established and its head appointed, the Ministry of SOEs and the Minister of SOEs will continue to exercise their existing governmental and management functions over SOEs to ensure continuity of governance.`,
                article_conclusion: `Law 16/2025 marks a major reform of Indonesia’s SOEs governance landscape. Through the transformation of the Ministry of SOE into BP BUMN, the law seeks to improve oversight, enhance accountability and align SOEs management with national development priorities. Collectively, these changes reflect a strategic shift toward a more professional and investment-driven SOE ecosystem.

In light of these developments, SOEs should proactively review their governance structures, shareholding compositions and internal policies to ensure compliance with the new legal framework. Particular attention should be given to amendments of articles of association, realignment of approval and reporting processes, and close coordination with BP BUMN and BPI Danantara to clarify certain implementation details that remain unclear.

All and all, Law 16/2025 is expected to strengthen institutional clarity, improve operational efficiency and reinforce the strategic role of SOEs as key drivers of Indonesia’s economic and social development. The successful implementation of this reform will depend on effective coordination among regulators, holding entities and individual SOEs to translate the new legal structure into sustainable governance practice.`,

On 11 September 2025, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia (“**Government**”) issued Government Regulation No. 39 of 2025 on the Second Amendment to Government Regulation No. 96 of 2021 on the Implementation of Mineral and Coal Mining Business Activities (“**GR 39/2025**”).

Effective of its issuance, GR 39/2025 revokes and replaces several provisions of Government Regulation No. 96 of 2021, as previously amended by Government Regulation No. 25 of 2024 (collectively, “**GR 96/2021**”). The amendments are intended to align the regulatory framework governing mineral and coal mining operations with the latest legislative developments, specifically Law No. 2 of 2025 on the Fourth Amendment to Law No. 4 of 2009 on Mineral and Coal Mining (“**Law 2/2025**”, together with its precedecessors, “**Mining Law**”).

This update will highlight the key regulatory updates and changes introduced by GR 39/2025 and is meant to provide practical insights for mining companies and the related stakeholders to understand their potential implications and ensure ongoing compliance.`,
                article_content: `
-   **_More Detailed Priority Right Mechanism for Obtaining WIUP and WIUPK_**

GR 39/2025 provides a more comprehensive framework for the granting of priority rights (_pemberian prioritas_) as previously introduced under Law 2/2025. GR 39/2025 sets out clearer related procedures, including application submission, verification and approval stages. It also elaborates on the eligibility criteria and requirements that an applicant must satisfy to qualify for a priority rights allocation.

GR 39/2025 also stipulates the maximum area limits for each Mining Business Permit Area (_Wilayah Izin Usaha Pertambangan_  or “**WIUP**”) and Special Mining Business Permit Area (_Wilayah Izin Usaha Pertambangan Khusus_  or “**WIUPK**”), differentiated by the type of business entities and type of mining resource. For instance, state-owned enterprises and private companies engaged in value-added processing or downstream activities may be granted with areas of up to 25,000 hectares for metal mineral WIUPs and 15,000 hectares for coal WIUPs.

-   **_Grace Period for Extension of Production Operation IUP and IUPK_**

GR 39/2025 now permits any Mining Business Licenses (_Izin Usaha Pertambangan_  or “**IUP**”) and IUPK holders operating in the production operation stage to be granted with a maximum one-year extension following the expiry of their IUPs and IUPKs, provided that the relevant license holders have submitted the required application documents for the extension of their expired IUPs and IUPKs but require additional time to fulfil certain outstanding obligations, including to (i) complete outstanding permits or licenses, (ii) fulfil certain payment obligations to the Government and/or (iii) complete the development of supporting infrastructure and facilities.

-   **_New Environmental Audit Obligation for CoW and PKP2B Holders Applying for IUPK_**

GR 39/2025 introduces an additional requirement for holders of Contracts of Work (_Kontrak Karya_) or Coal Mining Concession Agreements (_Perjanjian Karya Pengusahaan Pertambangan Batubara_) who intend to convert their concession to an IUPK, where now such concession holders must also include the results of an environmental audit conducted by an accredited third party on their application.

-   **_Subcontracting by Mining Contractor_**

GR 39/2025 provides that any mining contractor intending to subcontract part of its mining activities must first obtain approval from the relevant IUP or IUPK holder.

Furthermore, GR 39/2025 requires any foreign investment mining contractor companies to subcontract part of their work to local or national mining contractors. However, GR 39/2025 does not specify which types of work or the proportion of activities that must be subcontracted. It is expected that these details will be further regulated by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (“**MEMR**”) through a subsequent implementing regulation.

-   **_Stricter Requirements on Exploration IUP Extension_**

GR 39/2025 introduces stricter requirements for IUP holders applying a one-year extension of their exploration-stage IUP.

In addition to the existing requirements set out under Law 2/2025, the IUP holder must now also demonstrate that (i) it has submitted an exploration activity report detailing any technical or social challenges encountered, (ii) the extension is required to complete other permits or licenses, and (iii) there is evidence of preparation and mobilization of the necessary infrastructure and equipment.

-   **_Additional Requirement for Applying for Production Operation IUPK_**

GR 39/2025 adds a new requirement for exploration-stage IUPK holders to upgrade their IUPK into production operation-stage IUPK. Under the new regime, the applicant must first submit a full-area development plan (_rencana pengembangan seluruh wilayah_), which will include, among others, the quantity and location of resources and/or reserves allocated for mining activities up to the extension period, for approval by the MEMR. Only after obtaining such approval may the applicant proceed to apply for the conversion of its IUPK to a production operation stage IUPK.

Consequently, the separate requirement under the previous regime to submit a proposed WIUPK map with coordinates has been removed, as this requirement has been replaced by the full-area development plan.

-   **_Limitation on Assignment of Alluvial Mineral Mining Activities to Mining Contractor_**

Under the previous regime, GR 96/2021 did not specify any criteria on the eligibility of mining contractor conducting alluvial mineral extraction.

GR 39/2025 now introduces a specific limitation where production operation-stage IUP or IUPK holders may now assign such activities only to fully-owned domestic mining contractor.

-   **_Expanded Grounds for MEMR Approval to Engage Affiliated Mining Contractor_**

GR 39/2025 reaffirms the position under the Mining Law that IUP and IUPK holders are prohibited from engaging their subsidiaries or affiliated companies in mining service activities without MEMR prior written approval. Under the Mining Law, such approval could only be granted if (i) no equivalent mining contractor operated within the relevant area  **or**  (ii) no capable or interested mining contractor was available to perform the work.

GR 39/2025 expands these grounds by introducing an additional basis for MEMR approval, i.e., when no mining contractor expresses interest in undertaking the required activities.

-   **_Reclamation and Post-Mining Obligations for Reutilized Former WIUP and WIUPK Areas_**

GR 39/2025 clarifies the continuation of reclamation and post-mining obligations for former WIUP and WIUPK areas that are later reutilized or reoperated. Under the new framework, former permit holder remains responsible to carry out reclamation and/or post-mining activities in accordance with the approved reclamation plan until a new license for that particular area is issued and the latest reclamation report has been submitted.

Once the respective area is reoperated, the new license holder assumes full responsibility for completing 100% of the reclamation and post-mining obligations associated with the reutilized area.

-   **_Expanded Domestic Supply Obligation for Production Operation IUP and IUPK Holders_**

GR 39/2025 broadens the domestic supply obligations imposed on production operation-stage IUP and IUPK holders by requiring them to prioritize the supply of minerals and/or coal for domestic consumption, particularly to state-owned enterprises engaged in sectors critical to public welfare. These sectors include, among others, electricity, energy supply, fertilizer production and other strategic national industries. Furthermore, other than to satisfy the existing refined coal requirement, any foreign coal sales are now subject to prior explicit confirmation from MEMR.

-   **_Transitional Provisions_**

To ensure legal certainty and continuity during the the regulatory transition period, GR 39/2025 includes several key transitional provisions as follows:

1.  Based on the evaluation of the Central Government, IUP holders whose area overlapped with other WIUP may be revoked and returned to the Government. However, the relevant IUP holders whose IUP is revoked may also file objections through prescribed administrative procedures.
2.  IUPs and IUPKs issued prior to GR 39/2025 will remain valid until their respective expiry date.
3.  IUP, IUPK, People’s Mining Permit (_Izin Pertambangan Rakyat_ or “**IPR**”) or Rock Mining License (_Surat Izin Penambangan Batuan_) holders who fail to comply with applicable laws may be subject to area relinquishment or permit revocation based on MEMR’s evaluation.
4.  A holder of multiple production operation-stage IUPs may merge its WIUP, provided that the type of the mining resources and the activities stage are the same.
5.  Existing mining permits (IUP, IUPK or IPR) are protected from changes in spatial or land-use designation. If the Central or Regional Government later alters the spatial use of such areas, mining permit holders may continue their mining operations until the permit’s expiry, including its first and second extensions.
6.  The duration of production operation stages may be adjusted based on the approved feasibility study and the size of resources or reserves, provided the current permit duration has not yet reached the maximum permitted period.`,
                article_conclusion: `GR 39/2025 marks a significant step in refining Indonesia’s mineral and coal mining regulatory framework. It introduces clearer mechanisms for the granting of priority rights, and expands domestic supply obligations. The regulation also tightens eligibility and procedural standards for IUP and IUPK extensions, adds new prerequisites for the conversion of exploration-stage IUPKs to production operation-stage IUPKs, and enhances environmental compliance obligations, reflecting the Government’s continued focus on governance, transparency and sustainable resource management.

In addition, GR 39/2025 reinforces the role of local participation in mining services by restricting subcontracting and delegation arrangements to domestic mining contractors, while expanding the grounds under which affiliates may be engaged.

Overall, these changes underscore the Government’s policy direction toward promoting downstream value creation, prioritizing domestic resource utilization and enhancing administrative oversight across the mining sector. Mining companies, contractors and stakeholders are advised to review their operational structures, licensing portfolios, and compliance frameworks to align with the new requirements and to anticipate further implementing regulations expected to follow GR 39/2025.`,

                slug: "indonesias-latest-regime-on-risk-based-business-licensing-system-under-bkpm-regulation-no-52025",
                article_background: `On 1 October 2025, the Minister of Investment and Downstream Industry/Head of the Investment Coordinating Board (the “**BKPM**”) issued Regulation No. 5 of 2025 on Guidelines and Procedures for the Implementation of Risk-Based Business Licensing and Investment Facilities Through the Electronically Integrated Business Licensing System (Online Single Submission) (“**MR 5/2025**”). MR 5/2025, which took effect on 2 October 2025, was enacted as the implementing regulation of the recently issued Government Regulation No. 28 of 2025 on Risk-Based Business Licensing (“**GR 28/2025**”). For GR 28/2025, please refer to our publication linked  [here](https://ditralaw.com/indonesias-new-risk-based-licensing-regime/).

MR 5/2025 effectively revokes and replaces three previous regulations issued by BKPM in 2021, namely:

-   BKPM Regulation No. 3 of 2021 on Electronically Integrated Risk-Based Business Licensing System;
-   BKPM Regulation No. 4 of 2021 on Guidelines and Procedures for Risk-Based Business Licensing Services and Investment Facilities (“**BKPM Regulation No. 4 of 2021**”); and
-   BKPM Regulation No. 5 of 2021 on Guidelines and Procedures for the Supervision of Risk-Based Business Licensing.

MR 5/2025 provides further elaboration of the provisions previously stipulated under GR 28/2025, thus providing clearer guidance on their implementation, while introducing several important updates and adjustments intended to refine existing regulatory requirements.

This update aims to highlight the key provisions set forth under MR 5/2025 relevant to business actors concerning their licensing obligations, compliance requirements and ongoing operational processes.`,
                article_content: `
-   **_Lowered Minimum Capital Requirement and Capital Retention Requirement for Foreign Investment Companies_**

MR 5/2025 introduces a significant amendment by lowering the minimum issued and paid-up capital for foreign investment companies (“**PT PMA**”) from IDR10 billion to IDR2,5 billion, unless higher thresholds apply under specific sectoral rules. Furthermore, the paid-up capital for PT PMA must be retained in its bank account for at least 12 months from its payment date, except when the capital is utilised for asset acquisition, building construction or business operations.

However, this adjustment does not affect the minimum total investment requirement, which generally remains above IDR10 billion per 5-digit KBLI per business location, subject to certain exemptions.

This amendment provides greater financial flexibility for foreign investors in managing their company’s capitalisation, as the minimum total investment value of IDR10 billion may now be fulfilled not only through paid-up capital but also through other means such as loans.

-   **_Recognition of Land and Buildings Costs in Investment and/or Capital Calculation_**

Previously, the calculation of capital threshold and/or investment requirement applicable to any Indonesian companies of any business scale (including PT PMA) consistently excluded land and buildings costs. MR 5/2025 now provides exception to such requirement, allowing companies in certain sectors to include land and building costs in the calculation of their capital and/or investment value.

This exception applies to companies engaged in: (i) property, including construction, sale and/or leasing of property, (ii) provision of short-term or long-term accommodation, (iii) agriculture, (iv) plantation, (v) animal husbandry and/or (vi) aquaculture business activities.

-   **_Foreign Investment Threshold in the Property Sector_**

MR 5/2025 provides a specific investment threshold for PT PMA engaging in property development and management business as follows:

1.  a minimum investment of more than IDR10 billion,  **including**  land and buildings, for projects involving a complete building or integrated housing complex; and
2.  a minimum investment of more than IDR10 billion,  **excluding**  land and buildings, for standalone property units and standalone housing projects.

-   **_New Clarity_** **_on Investment Requirement in Food and Beverage Services_**

Under GR 28/2025, food and beverage services businesses must have a minimum investment above IDR10 billion per the first 2-digit KBLI for each business location point, excluding land and building costs. MR 5/2025 now provided the interpretation of “location point” by confirming that the investment requirement applies per regency or city, rather than per individual outlet.

Accordingly, multiple outlets located within the same regency or city will therefore be aggregated under a single IDR10 billion investment thresholds, while outlets in different regions must meet the threshold separately.

-   **_Investment Requirement for Foreign Investment in Public EV Charging Stations_**

MR 5/2025 sets specific investment thresholds for PT PMA engaged in the operation of public electric vehicle (“**EV**”) charging stations. The minimum investment value for such PT PMA remains above IDR10 billion, excluding land and buildings. However, such investment value requirement is calculated based on the amount of province in which the PT PMA operates its public EV charging stations, regardless of the number of charging stations within each province. Therefore, operating across multiple provinces requires a proportional increase in the total investment requirement (e.g. IDR20 billion for two provinces).

-   **_Special Minimum Investment Requirements in KEK_**

MR 5/2025 provides that PT PMA operating within a Special Economic Zones (_Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus_ or “**KEK**”) is subject to the minimum investment requirements under Presidential Regulation No. 10 of 2021 on Investment Business Fields (as amended) (“**PR 10/2021**”)

This requirement applies to business activities located in the following KEK categories: (i) KEK for production and processing, (ii) KEK for logistics and distribution, (iii) KEK for research, digital economy, and technology development, (iv) KEK for tourism, and/or (v) KEK for energy development.

Therefore, the general IDR10 billion minimum investment threshold and its exceptions under MR 5/2025 do not apply to certain PT PMA operating within these designated KEK. MR 5/2025 reaffirms the provision under PR 10/2021 that digital startup PT PMA which operates in these KEK are not subject to minimum investment requirement under MR 5/2025.

-   **_Waiver of KKPR Requirements_**

MR 5/2025 refines the requirements for obtaining and maintaining a Spatial Utilization Suitability (_Kesesuaian Kegiatan Pemanfaatan Ruang_  or “**KKPR**”), specifically on the exemption to obtain additional KKPR.

Under MR 5/2025, certain business activities are exempted from obtaining a KKPR. For instance, a KKPR is not required in the case of expansion of existing operations through additional supporting infrastructure, buildings and facilities, provided that (i) the business already holds a valid location permit or KKPR and/or land right; (ii) the expansion is located in the same area and for the same business activity; and (iii) the activities are conducted by the same business actor.

-   **_Simplified KKPR and Environmental Approval for Supporting Business Activities_**

MR 5/2025 simplifies the process for business actors whose supporting business activities are located within the same physical location as their main business activities. Under MR 5/2025, such business actor may use their existing KKPR and Environmental Approval, which they have already obtained for their main business activities. However, this relaxation does not extend to Building Approval (_Persetujuan Bangunan Gedung_) and Function Worthy Certificate (_Sertifikat Laik Fungsi_), where business actors must still obtain such licenses separately.

-   **_Consolidated Business Licensing for Single Production Lines_**

Under MR 5/2025, a single Business License (_Perizinan Berusaha_  or “**Business License**”) now can be applied for multiple main business activities that operate within a single production line.

To further explain, a single production line refers to business operations that (i) fall within the same industry sector and use an integrated machinery/technology process to produce multiple outputs under different KBLI codes within the same location; or (ii) fall within other sector (other than industrial sector) but uses the multiple KBLI codes within the same location.

-   **_Direct Construction Facilities for Businesses in Certain Industrial Areas_**

MR 5/2025 introduces a streamlined licensing mechanism for business actors engaged in Medium-High Risk or High-Risk scale business located within a government-designated Industrial Area (_Kawasan Industri_). Such business actors may obtain direct construction facilities, which allows them to automatically obtain, upon request, the relevant Business License from the Online Single Submission (“**OSS**”) system.

-   **_Extended LKPM Submission Period_**

MR 5/2025 maintains the requirement for all business actors to submit periodic Investment Activity Report (_Laporan Kegiatan Penanaman Modal_  or “**LKPM**”), but introduces extended submission deadline as follows:

1. Small-scale business: by the 15th of the subsequent month following each semester (January and July).
2.  Medium and Large-scale business: by the 15th of the subsequent month following each quarter (April, July, October and January).

-   **_Licensing Exemptions for Businesses in Shared Commercial Location_**

MR 5/2025 reaffirms that business actors engaged in ‘trade or service activities’ within a building or complex whose manager or owner already holds the Basic Requirements are exempt from obtaining these requirements individually.

MR 5/2025 clarifies that ‘trade or service activities’ refer to activities that do not involve the construction of a building and further defines shared commercial location to include malls, modern or traditional markets, office buildings, airport, hospital and other similar trade or service complexes.

-   **_Transitional Provisions_**

To ensure legal certainty and a smooth transition, MR 5/2025 includes several transitional provisions aimed at aligning ongoing and future licensing activities with the new framework, among others:

1.  Basic Requirements, Business License, and/or Supporting Business Licenses (_Perizinan Berusaha untuk Menunjang Kegiatan Usaha_  or “**PB-UMKU**”) that were issued and are still valid before MR 5/2025 took effect may continue to be used in accordance with the prevailing laws and regulations.
2.  Applications for Basic Requirements, Business License, PB-UMKU, and/or any investment facilities submitted before MR 5/2025 takes effect, but are still in process, will continue to be processed based on BKPM Regulation No. 4 of 2021.
3.  The capital and minimum investment provisions for PT PMA under MR 5/2025 do not apply when the business actor undertakes any change of its business location, expansion of its business and/or applies for an extension of its existing Business License.
4.  PT PMA which has already obtained its Business License and is planning to change of its business location, expand its business and/or apply for an extension of its existing Business License, is still subject to the minimum capital and investment amount as required under MR 5/2025.`,
                article_conclusion: `MR 5/2025 represents a significant step in Indonesia’s ongoing regulatory reform, reinforcing a more efficient and investor-oriented business licensing framework. By refining procedures, lowering capital thresholds and clarifying sector-specific requirements, the regulation strengthens the role of the OSS system and supports Indonesia’s ease of doing business agenda.

To align with the new regime, business actors should review their licensing portfolios, reassess capital and investment structures and leverage newly introduced exemptions to streamline compliance. Close coordination with OSS authorities and regulators is recommended to ensure smooth implementation, particularly during transitional periods.

Ultimately, MR 5/2025 is poised to enhance regulatory certainty, reduce administrative burdens and bolster investor confidence, positioning Indonesia as a more competitive destination for foreign and domestic investment.`,

                article_background: `On 30 June 2025, the Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Indonesia (_Kementerian Perdagangan Republik Indonesia_  or “**MOT**”) issued MOT Regulation No. 16 of 2025 on Import Policy and Provisions (“**MOTR 16/2025**”), which introduces major changes to Indonesia’s import governance framework. MOTR 16/2025, which takes effect on 30 August 2025, repeals and replaces MOT Regulation No. 36 of 2023 on the same subject (as lastly amended by MOT Regulation No. 8 of 2024, “**MOTR 36/2023**”).

MOTR 16/2025 intends to simplify import procedures, remove regulatory overlaps and strengthen compliance oversight. It also aims to facilitate access to strategic goods and raw materials, while promoting the development of domestic industries through more disciplined import governance.

Importantly, MOTR 16/2025 serves as the umbrella import regulation for eight newly issued, sector-specific import regulations (including those covering textiles, agriculture and livestock, fisheries, salt, chemicals and hazardous substances, mining inputs, electronics and telematics, consumer goods and non-new or non-hazardous waste). This update outlines key provisions introduced by MOTR 16/2025 and aims to provide practical insights to help importers navigating the revised import regime.`,
                article_content: `New rules and key changes introduced under MOTR 16/2025 are as follows:

-   **Clarified Definition for Imported Goods**

MOTR 16/2025 has now clarified several key terms of goods that were not specifically defined in MOTR 36/2023, including:

1.  Categories of imported goods, which include Restricted Import Goods (_Barang Dibatasi Impo__r_), Freely Importable Goods (_Barang Bebas Impor_) and Prohibited Import Goods (_Barang Dilarang Impor_); and
2.  Categories of imported manufacturing goods, which include Complementary Goods (_Barang Komplementer_), Goods for Market Testing (_Barang untuk Keperluan Tes Pasar_), and Goods for After-Sales Services (_Barang untuk Pelayanan Purna Jual_).

These definitions provide clearer legal interpretation, reduce ambiguity and lay a stronger foundation for consistent policy enforcement across sectors.

-   **Relaxed** **API-U to API-P Conversion Requirements**

MOTR 16/2025 simplifies the requirements for converting a Business Identification Number (_Nomor Induk Berusaha_  or “**NIB**“) with a General Import License (_Angka Pengenal Importir Umum_  or “**API-U**“) status to an NIB with a Producer Import License (_Angka Pengenal Importir Produsen_  or “**API-P**“) status.

Under the previous regime, MOTR 36/2023 requires importers, who wish to convert their API-U to API-P, to meet two requirements: (i) complete all import activities in accordance with their existing Import Approvals (_Persetujuan Impor_) and/or Surveyor Reports (_Laporan Surveyor_); and (ii) maintain an active API-U status for at least one year prior to conversion.

MOTR 16/2025 removes these restrictive requirements, allowing importers to convert their API-U to API-P even if they do not hold any valid Import Approvals and/or Surveyor Reports. Additionally, conversion is also permitted even if the importers hold those licenses but are not conducting any import activities.

-   **Expanded Exceptions of Trading or Transferring Goods Imported under API-P**

Both MOTR 36/2023 and MOTR 16/2025 set out the categories of goods that the holders of NIB with API-P status may import and subsequently trade or transfer to other parties. While MOTR 16/2025 retains the categories provided under the previous regime, it introduces one new category i.e., capital goods, raw materials, auxiliary materials and/or other production-supporting materials originating from the exporting country, provided that these goods are later re-exported and their quantity does not exceed the amount stated in the original customs declaration.

-   **Streamlined Import Licenses Processing and Approval Timelines**

MOTR 16/2025 now also provides maximum time period for the administrative review of any applications related to the issuance, amendment or extension of any Import Licenses (including API-U, API-P and Import Approval). The administrative review must now conclude within 15 (fifteen) working days from the application date.

To further enhance legal certainty, MOTR 16/2025 introduces a new mechanism whereby the INATRADE system, which is integrated with the Indonesia National Single Window (INSW) system, will, within 5 (five) working days upon receipt of complete application documents, automatically issue the relevant Import Licenses regardless of whether the system fails to issue the relevant Import Licenses within the prescribed deadline. These changes reduce uncertainty and delays in licensing, helping importers plan and execute import operations more efficiently.

-   **Additional Ground for Temporary Suspension of Import Approvals**

While MOTR 16/2025 retains the existing grounds for temporary suspension of the issuance, amendment or renewal of any Import Approval on MOTR 36/2023, it now provides an additional ground for suspension. Under MOTR 16/2025, Import Approvals process may also be suspended if an investigation is required due to alleged violations of import policies and regulations on certain goods, particularly those are subject to post-border trade activity monitoring.

-   **Exception on the Obligation to Import Only New Products**

MOTR 36/2023 explicitly outlined several exceptions under which certain used goods could be imported, including (i) capital goods that are insufficiently sourced domestically, for use in industrial production aimed at export development and other purposes, (ii) goods for reconstruction following natural disasters; and (iii) residues, scrap or remnants (excluding hazardous and toxic waste) used as raw or auxiliary materials for industrial use.

While MOTR 16/2025 maintains the general principle that used goods can be imported under applicable laws and regulations, ministerial authority, or based on technical recommendations from relevant government agencies, it no longer provides the detailed exceptions previously stipulated under MOTR 36/2023.

-   **Classification of Freely Imported Goods**

MOTR 16/2025 retains the general rule that certain goods are allowed to be freely imported by parties not eligible to hold a NIB functioning as an API and the imports are not for commercial purposes. However, MOTR 16/2025 now provides distinct provisions and more detailed rules for two categories i.e. (i) goods intended for the use of government institutions, state agencies and/or public, which now also include goods for the needs of the head of state, and (ii) goods for sporting purposes, imported by the national sports federations or committees.

Under the previous regime, these goods must be imported directly by the relevant institution, organization or agency. MOTR 16/2025 now permits those parties to appoint third-party importers to conduct the import process on their behalf.

Another key change involves the scope of goods permitted to be imported by those parties. While previously limited to freely importable goods, the scope now expands to restricted goods, provided that all applicable requirements are fulfilled.

-   **Narrowed Eligibility for Import of Manufacturing Goods by Industrial Sectors**

MOTR 16/2025, similar to MOTR 36/2023, specifies industrial sectors that are permitted to import manufacturing goods classified as Complementary Goods and Goods for Market Testing. However, MOTR 16/2025 narrows this eligibility by removing certain industries previously listed in MOTR 36/2023, such as (i) cereal food industry, (ii) infant food industry and (ii) chocolate and confectionery food industry.

-   **New List on Used Restricted Import Goods not for Business Purpose**

MOTR 16/2025 provides clearer guidance on categories of restricted used goods that may be imported for non-commercial purposes, specifically listing the goods that fall under these categories. This applies to both importers without a NIB functioning as an API and those with such API status, subject to applicable requirements. For example, MOTR 16/2025 includes iron or steel, alloy steel and their derivatives, tires, ceramics, and sheet and safety glass, all of which may be imported by eligible parties for research or scientific development.

-   **Amended Import Reporting Obligations**

Under the previous regime, MOTR 36/2023 required importers holding any Import Licenses (including Import Approval) as well as any Surveyor’s Report to submit monthly import realization report, no later than the 15th  of the following month. MOTR 16/2025 narrow this obligation whereby only importers with import licenses or approvals are now required to submit monthly reports, regardless of whether any imports have occurred.

Meanwhile, importers holding a Surveyor’s Report who have realized their importation must submit the realisation report no later than 30 calendar days after using the Surveyor’s Report as a customs clearance document.

-   **Improved Supervision of Imported Products**

The supervision of import-related business licensing compliance in MOTR 16/2025 now occurs at both the border and post-border. This represents a significant shift from the previous approach under MOTR 36/2023, where inspections were conducted only after goods had cleared customs (post-border).

This dual-layered supervision framework indicates the government’s commitment to tighten regulatory enforcement from the point of entry. Importers must now ensure strict compliance with licensing, documentation, and trade-related obligations both at the border and after customs clearance.

-   **More Structured Sanction Regime**

MOTR 16/2025 retains most administrative sanctions previously set out under MOTR 36/2023 but introduces a more structured and tiered enforcement framework. Under the new regime, importers may face sanctions for specific violations, including inconsistencies between submitted application documents and the issued Import Licenses, importation of goods in types or quantities that deviate from the issued Import Licenses, and failure to submit a mandatory Surveyor’s Report.

-   **Revocation of Import Approval for Several Commodities**

Under the transitional provisions of MOTR 16/2025, all previously issued Import Approvals for certain commodities will be revoked and deemed invalid as of 30 August 2025. This revocation applies regardless of whether importers obtained these approvals under an API-U or an API-P. The affected commodities include forestry products, plastic raw materials, subsidized fertilizers, fuels, fuel blends, and other fuel types not classified as standard fuel or blends and other commodities. Any pending applications for Import Approvals related to these commodities will no longer be processed, and the relevant importers must submit new applications in accordance with the requirements provided under MOTR 16/2025.

-   **Transitional Provisions**

To ensure legal certainty and a smooth transition, MOTR 16/2025 includes several transitional provisions aimed at aligning import activities with the new framework, among others:

1.  Any Import Licenses previously issued by the authorities under the previous regime (including MOTR 36/2023), shall remain valid until their respective expiry dates and may be amended or extended, provided that the changes do not conflict with the provisions of MOTR 16/2025.
2.  Save for application for Import Approvals related to certain commodities as referred in the above, applications for Import Licenses submitted prior to the effective date of this Regulation and still under review shall continue to be processed, as long as they do not conflict with the new provisions under MOTR 16/2025.
3.  Supporting documents such as verification reports, technical considerations, exemptions, explanatory letters, certificates, recommendations, and other related documents issued by ministries, non-ministerial government agencies, or other relevant institutions prior to 30 August 2025 shall remain valid until their expiration, provided they are not inconsistent with this Regulation.

Imported goods that arrive at the port of destination, as evidenced by customs documents (BC 1.1 manifest), shall be subject to the import policies and regulations under MOTR 16/2025.`,
                article_conclusion: `MOTR 16/2025 fundamentally shifts Indonesia’s import governance framework. By repealing and replacing MOTR 36/2023, MOTR 16/2025 consolidates and streamlines previously fragmented rules while introducing significant procedural and substantive changes. These include clearer definitions or classifications for goods subject to import rules, enhanced flexibility in licensing conversions, streamlined timelines for administrative processes and reinforced dual-layered supervision mechanisms at both border and post-border levels.

Equally important are the more structured sanction regime and transitional measures, which provide importers a defined path to compliance. The revocation of existing import approvals for select commodities emphasises the government’s commitment to reassert control over critical sectors while fostering more transparent and strategic trade flows.

As MOTR 16/2025 takes effect on 30 August 2025, businesses engaged in import activities should immediately assess their current practices, identify any gaps and update their internal procedures to align with the new framework. Specifically, businesses importing commodities with revoked Import Approvals must ensure they reapply for these approvals.`,

                slug: "indonesias-new-risk-based-licensing-regime-gr-282025",
                article_background: `On 5 June 2025, the Government of Indonesia (“**Government**”) issued Government Regulation No. 28 of 2025 on the Implementation of Risk-Based Licensing (“**GR 28/2025**”) as part of its ongoing regulatory reform to refine and streamline the business licensing process. GR 28/2025 revokes and replaces Government Regulation No. 5 of 2021 on the same subject (“**GR 5/2021**”) to align with the latest legislative developments, particularly the enactment of Law No. 6 of 2023 on the Enactment of Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 2 of 2022 on Job Creation into Law. GR 28/2025 aims to enhance legal certainty, improve regulatory oversight, and support a more efficient licensing environment.

Notably, GR 28/2025 centralizes all licensing procedures through the Online Single Submission (“**OSS**”) system, which now serves as the front-end interface for business actors. Under this framework, business actors are only required to interact with the OSS system, while OSS coordinates directly with the relevant ministries and agencies on the backend. Despite this integration, the final licensing documents continue to be issued through the OSS system.

This update will highlight the key updates and changes introduced by GR 28/2025 and is meant to provide practical insights to help business actors understand the regulatory changes that may affect their licensing obligations and operational processes.`,
                article_content: `-   **_Stricter Emphasis on Basic Requirements_**

GR 28/2025 explicitly requires the fulfilment of Basic Requirements (_Persyaratan Dasar_) as a prerequisite for the issuance of a Business License (_Perizinan Berusaha_), unless certain exemption applies. This represents a refinement from the previous regime under GR 5/2021, which ambiguously allowed business actors to obtain Basic Requirements and/or a Business License without a clear sequence. Additionally, while GR 5/2021 generally deferred the specifics and requirements for Basic Requirements to separate sectoral regulations, GR 28/2025 consolidates and provides detailed elaboration on each Basic Requirement within GR 28/2025 itself.

-   **_More Structured Stages for Conducting Business Activities_**

GR 28/2025 introduces clearer and more structured stages for conducting business in Indonesia by expressly distinguishing between two main stages as follows:

-   Starting a Business (**initial**  **stage**)

The initial stage includes (i) fulfilling all legal entity establishment formalities, (ii) fulfilling certain Basic Requirements and (ii) applying for or obtaining the relevant Business License (as applicable), in accordance with the nature of the business activity.

-   Operating a Business

Once the initial stage is completed, GR 28/2025 requires business actors to proceed to the operational stage, which is divided into two sub-stages:

1.  **preparation stage**, which may include various preparation activities such as land acquisition, fulfilment of certain Basic Requirements, building construction, procurement of equipment or facilities, recruitment of human resources, fulfillment of business standards, and/or fulfilling Business License requirements; and
2.  **operational and/or commercial stage**, which refers to the core business activities such as production, logistics and distribution, marketing of goods and/or services, and other activities necessary for operational and/or commercial purposes.

GR 28/2025 marks a departure from the previous regime under GR 5/2021 by clearly differentiating the initial stage from the preparation stage. This new framework helps business actors to better understand their regulatory obligations and the appropriate timing for securing the necessary licenses throughout the business lifecycle.

-   **_Expanded Business Sectors_**

GR 28/2025 also expands the number of regulated business sectors from 16 sectors under GR 5/2021 to a total of 22 sectors to include several new sectors, namely legal metrology, creative economy, geospatial information, cooperatives and capital investment.

The expansion of regulated business sectors under GR 28/2025 consequently introduces an updated and/or amended list of covered Business Classifications (_Klasifikasi Baku Lapangan Usaha Indonesia_  or “**KBLI**”), including holding companies and other management consultancy activities under capital investment sector, and visual communication design or graphic design activity as well as film, video, television programs, animation and comics specialized design activity under creative economy sector.

-   **_Updated Risk Levels, Supervising Authorities and PB-UMKU Requirements_**

GR 28/2025 also updates and/or amends the applicable risk levels and applicable Supporting Business Licenses (_Perizinan Berusaha untuk Menunjang Kegiatan Usaha_  or “**PB-UMKU**”) obligations for certain sectors. These changes are detailed in the Schedule to GR 28/2025, which consolidates sectoral requirements into a more coherent reference framework. A notable example is restaurant business, where under GR 5/2021, the risk level was determined by the seating capacity, ranging from low to high risk. Under GR 28/2025, the classification is now based on business scale of the relevant company operating its restaurant, with micro businesses categorized as medium-low risk, and small, medium and large businesses classified as medium-high risk.

Another key update under GR 28/2025 is the clarification of supervising authorities for certain businesses, which under the previous regime were supervised by multiple ministries. This update enhances legal certainty for business actors by designating a single ministry authority for certain businesses wherever possible. For example, the Government has now assigned sole supervision of businesses engaged in the medical and dental equipment, orthopaedic and prosthetic equipment industry, which was previously under the joint supervision of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Health, to Ministry of Industry.

-   **_Legal Certainty in Licensing Process Through Fictitious Positive Approval_**

GR 28/2025 improves the legal certainty and the ease of business licensing process by introducing a fictitious positive (_fiktif positif_) approval policy, whereby if the authority fails to respond to an application within the prescribed period, the OSS system will automatically advance the application to the next stage or issue the requested licenses. This approach streamlines the licensing process for business actors and minimizes bureaucratic delays.

For instance, the application for Environmental Licenses may involve several assessments, such as (i) emission and wastewater assessments, (ii) hazardous waste assessment and (iii) traffic impact assessment, which must be completed within 30, 16, and 23 working days, respectively. If the OSS system does not respond within the deadline for any given assessment, the applicant may proceed to the next step by submitting proof of submission of the relevant assessment application, without waiting for the corresponding technical approval.

Further, under GR 28/2025, if a business actor applies for a technical consideration (_pertimbangan teknis_) as a prerequisite for the Suitability of Spatial Utilization (_Kesesuaian Kegiatan Pemanfaatan Ruang_  or “**KKPR**”) and the relevant authority fails to issue such technical consideration within 20 working days from receiving complete application documents, the OSS will automatically issue the KKPR without the technical consideration.

Similarly, for medium-high and high-risk business classifications, if the relevant ministry or agency fails to verify and respond to the Business License application through the OSS system within the prescribed time frame, the OSS system will automatically issue the relevant Business License.

-   **_Simplification of the Environmental Approval Process_**

GR 28/2025 significantly simplifies the Environmental Approval (_Persetujuan Lingkungan_) process, reducing procedural burden and streamlining compliance through the OSS system. Some key simplifications include:

1.  All Environmental Approval applications are now processed through the OSS system, removing the need for business actors to coordinate with multiple ministries or local authorities.
2.  Under previous regime, Environmental Approval and Technical Approval (_Persetujuan Teknis_) had to be obtained sequentially. GR 28/2025 introduces a key change in which both approvals may now be applied for and obtained in parallel through the OSS system, provided specific requirements are met by the applicant.
3.  For business actors engaging in business activities under multiple KBLIs within a single, integrated location or ecosystem, their environmental licensing requirement will be determined based on the highest risk classification among those KBLIs. This approach streamlines approvals by eliminating duplication and supporting ecosystem-based licensing.
4.  Unlike GR 22/2021, which required business actors to directly involve affected communities, GR 28/2025 shifts this responsibility to the relevant authority, which will manage the collection of input from such community during the substantive review stage. This removes a major procedural burden from businesses.

-   **_Clarification of Environmental Compliance Obligations for Tenants in Designated Areas_**

GR 28/2025 also clarifies guidelines on the environmental compliance obligations for business actors operating as tenants within (i) Industrial Areas (_Kawasan Industri_), (ii) Special Economic Zones (_Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus_ or “**KEK**”) and (iii) Free Trade and Free Port Zones (_Kawasan Perdagangan Bebas dan Pelabuhan Bebas_ or “**KPBPB**”), which have already obtained an area-wide Environmental Impact Assessment (_Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan_) and Environmental Approval. Under the new regime, such business actors will only need to prepare their Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (_Rencana Pengelolaan Lingkungan-Rencana Pemantauan Lingkungan Hidup_  or “**RKL-RPL**”), which must align with the environmental documents of that area.

Such RKL-RPL must be submitted to the operator or authority managing or operating the relevant area for approval. Once approved, the RKL-RPL serves as the business actor’s formal commitment to environmental management and is a prerequisite for obtaining their Business License.

-   **_Exemption from KKPR Requirements_**

GR 28/2025 has simplified the KKPR requirements for certain sectors, including micro, small and medium enterprises (“**MSME**”), which now may obtain KKPR through a self-declaration form via the OSS system. Additionally, business actors in the renewable energy, mineral and coal sectors are exempt from obtaining KKPR during early-stage activities. Specifically, during the survey and exploration phases in the new and renewable energy and energy conservation sub-sectors, or during the exploration phase in the mineral and coal sub-sector. These changes aim to reduce regulatory burdens during preliminary project development.

-   **_Supporting Business Activities are Now Allowed to Generate Revenue_**

GR 28/2025 now also allows business actors to earn income from their supporting business activities. Under the previous regime, GR 5/2021 prohibited supporting business activities from generating revenue. This change provides greater commercial flexibility, particularly for integrated business models where supporting services (e.g., logistics, warehousing, or facility management) play a critical role alongside the main business.

-   **_Relaxation of Foreign Investment Restrictions for Certain KBLIs_**

GR 28/2025 revises the business scale classification for a number of sectors, allowing large-scale businesses to operate in such sectors that were previously reserved for MSME. This means these sectors are now technically open to foreign investment. Notable sectors include retail of non-alcohol beverages, traditional medicine for human use, rice and retail of various goods that are primarily foods, beverages or tobacco in minimarkets. These changes mark a significant opening up of Indonesia’s foreign investment landscape, particularly in the consumer and retail sectors. With this development, the Government is expected to revise the current positive investment list to reflect these updates and ensure consistency between GR 28/2025 and the list of sectors open to foreign investors under the positive investment list.

-   **Introduction of Three New Subsystems under GR 28/2025**

GR 28/2025 expands the OSS’s system functionality by introducing three new sub-systems, bringing the total to six subsystems. These additions aim to streamline investment processes and strengthen compliance monitoring. These new subsystems include:

1.  Basic Requirements Subsystem, which facilitates access to information and submission of applications related to Basic Requirements, namely KKPR, Environmental Approval, Building Approval (_Persetujuan Bangunan Gedung_  or “**PBG**”) and Function Worthy Certificate (_Sertifikat Laik Fungsi_  or “**SLF**”).
2.  Investment Facilities Subsystem, which allows business actors to apply for various investment incentives, such as import duty exemptions and income tax reductions for eligible activities like research and development or vocational training activities.
3.  Partnership Subsystem, which enables business actors to monitor and fulfil their partnership obligations, including those between large-scale businesses and MSMEs, as required under prevailing investment regulations.

-   **_Harmonization of Licensing Standards through New NSPK Regulations_**

The Government continues its effort to standardize business licensing across Indonesia by reinforcing the authority of national Norms, Standards, Procedures and Criteria (“**NSPK**”). Under the previous regime, GR 5/2021 stipulated that NSPK on risk-based business licensing would serve as a single national reference for the central Government, regional Government, KEK and KPBPB operators in implementing risk-based business licensing.

GR 28/2025 now goes further by expressly prohibiting regional governments from expanding or adding to the provisions set out in the national NSPK when drafting implementing regulations at the regional level.

This prohibition aims to eliminate inconsistencies and curtail local discretion that was previously allowed to impose additional licensing requirements at the regional level, thereby ensuring uniformity of licensing standards nationwide and reducing regulatory burdens on businesses. This update is expected to enhance the ease of doing business and improve investors’ confidence in the Indonesian regulatory environment.

-   **_Integrated Licensing Procedure via the OSS System_**

GR 28/2025 reinforces the centralization of business licensing by mandating that all risk-based business licensing processes be processed electronically through the OSS system, regardless of the supervising authority. This applies not only during the application and issuance of licenses but also to the imposition of administrative sanctions. A notable change under GR 28/2025 is the integration of PBG and SLF into the OSS system. Under the previous regime, these were handled through the Ministry of Public Works and Housing’s Building Management Information System (_Sistem Informasi Manajemen Bangunan Gedung_) platform.

Despite this general requirement, GR 28/2025 provides an exception for certain export and import-related licenses. GR 28/2025 requires that licensing for (i) exports, (ii) imports other than the Import Identification Number/API, (iii) import-export compliance obligations and (iv) commodity balance requirements must still be processed through the Indonesia National Single Window (INSW) system.

-   **_Broaden Administrative Sanction_**

GR 28/2025 introduces a significant shift by broadening the scope of administrative sanctions beyond those previously imposed to specific business sectors set under GR 5/2021, and business actors may now face administrative sanctions for violations against general provisions, including failure to obtain the required Basic Requirements, Business License and PB-UMKU. Sanctions range from written warnings to revocation of the relevant licenses, depending on the severity of the non-compliance determined through supervisory assessments conducted by relevant government officials. This expansion marks a shift toward more comprehensive enforcement and greater accountability under the risk-based licensing regime.

-   **_Transitional Provisions_**

To ensure legal certainty and a smooth transition, GR 28/2025 includes several transitional provisions aimed at aligning ongoing and future licensing activities with the new framework, among others:

1.  The Government has a maximum of four months from 5 June 2025 to issue the necessary implementing regulations and to update the OSS and Indonesia National Single Window systems accordingly. Drafts of several implementing regulations have already been made publicly available.
2.  Applications for Basic Requirements, Business License and/or PB-UMKU submitted before the OSS system is updated to align with GR 28/2025 will continue to be processed based on the framework of GR 5/2021.
3.  Business actors engaged in medium-high or high risk business activities that have obtained (i) a Standard Certificate that has not yet been verified, (ii) licenses that have not yet met all required obligations, or (iii) PB-UMKU that are not yet effective, may continue their activities in accordance with the provisions of GR 5/2021 during the four month transitional period.

Importantly, all licenses, approvals and certificates granted to business actors prior to the enactment of GR 28/2025 will remain valid, provided that they do not conflict with GR 28/2025. Relevant provisions of GR 5/2021 on the application of Basic Requirements, Business License and PB-UMKU will also continue to apply, to the extent they do not conflict with GR 28/2025.`,
                article_conclusion: `GR 28/2025 represents a significant step forward in Indonesia’s regulatory landscape by introducing a more structured, integrated and sector-specific approach to business licensing process. Through the consolidation of licensing processes within the OSS system, clearer delineation of institutional responsibilities and streamlined procedures such as fictitious positive approvals, GR 28/2025 aims to enhance legal certainty, reduce procedural burden and foster a more transparent and investor-friendly business environment. Business actors are now subject to more detailed compliance requirements, including sector-specific standards, clear timelines for permit issuance, and centralized digital processing, all of which are intended to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and increase transparency.

To ensure alignment with GR 28/2025, business actors should proactively assess their licensing status, conduct internal compliance reviews, and where relevant, update their operational procedures to ensure that all relevant business licenses are obtained and updated in accordance with GR 28/2025. Before and after the effectiveness of new OSS system, business actors are also encouraged to engage with OSS where necessary to ensure a smooth adjustment and full compliance with the new regulatory framework introduced by GR 28/2025.`,

                article_background: `On April 28, 2025, the Minister of Agrarian and Spatial Planning / National Land Agency (“**Minister**”) issued Regulation Number 5 of 2025 on the Delegation of Authority for the Granting of Land Rights and Land Registration Activities (“**MR 5/2025**”). This regulation repeals and replaces Minister Regulation Number 16 of 2022 (“**MR 16/2022**”), which had been recently amended in March 2025 by Minister Regulation Number 2 of 2025 (“**MR 2/2025**”).

Despite the short-lived nature of MR 2/2025, MR 5/2025 essentially restates the key changes to the land law framework that MR 2/2025 introduced. Additionally, MR 5/2025 clarifies certain provisions from the MR 2/2025 and introduces further revisions that largely build upon the provisions of MR 16/2022. Notably, MR 5/2025 sets out new provisions on the delegation and sub-delegation of the Minister’s authority in determining land rights, issuing land rights certificates and conducting land registration.

This client alert highlights the key changes introduced by MR 2/2025, as carried forward in the MR 5/2025, compared to the previous regime under the MR 16/2022 regime.`,
                article_content: `New rules and/or key changes introduced under MR 5/2025 or MR 2/2025, which remain under MR 5/2025, are as follows:

-   **Region Categorization**

The Indonesian law classifies regions in Indonesia into several categories based on factors such as land value, population density, and geographical conditions. This classification will determine which authority, or institution has jurisdiction to issue land rights. Each category applies different thresholds for assigning this authority. Furthermore, MR 5/2025 introduces specific thresholds for land located within the Free Trade Zone and Free Port Area of Batam and the Nusantara Capital City Area, which were not addressed under MR 2/2025 or MR 16/2022.

-   **Recommendation for Reissuance of Land Rights**

Certain land rights are granted only for a specific period. Once this period ends, landowners may apply for a reissuance. MR 5/2025 allows the Minister to delegate the authority to issue the necessary recommendations for such reissuance:

1.  For land rights held by legal entities, the recommendation may be issued by the Director General of Land Rights and Registration (_Direktorat Jenderal Penetapan Hak dan Pendaftaran Tanah_).
2.  For land rights held by individuals, the recommendation may be issued by the Head of the Regional Land Office (_Kepala Kantor Wilayah_).

-   **Division of Authority to Issue Land Rights**

Under MR/2025, the authority to issue land rights is held by (i) the Minister, (ii) the Head of the Regional Land Office, or (iii) the Head of the local Land Office (_Kepala Kantor Pertanahan_), depending on the type of the land rights and size of the land. MR 5/2025 revises the thresholds and criteria that determine which of these authorities is responsible for issuing land rights.

-   **Renewal or Extension of Building Use Right (_Hak Guna Bangunan_  or “HGB”) and Right to Use (_Hak Pakai_  or “HP”) for Land Parcels**

MR 5/2025 clarifies that the Head of the local Land Office is authorised to approve the renewal or extension of HGB or HP for land parcels resulting from subdivision, separation and consolidation processes, provided that the size of the land parcels does not exceed 600m2.

-   **Conversion of Right of Ownership (Hak Milik or “HM”) to HGB or HP**

MR 5/2025 clarifies the previously unclear provisions under MR 2/2025 concerning the conversion of HM to HGB or HP, which had been open to interpretation as only being possible through an auction. MR 5/2025 now confirms that such a conversion may be conducted in two ways:

1.  through an auction process;  **or**
2.  through relinquishing the HM to the state, followed by the granting of the new land rights, which is a practice that has already been implemented.

MR 5/2025 also repeals Minister Regulation Number 18 of 2021 on Procedures for the Establishment of Management Rights and Land Rights, except for the provisions governing the auction process, which remain in effect.`,
                article_conclusion: `MR 5/2025 reflects the government’s push to modernize land services and bring greater clarity to how land rights are managed. With clearer roles, streamlined procedures, and updated rules, MR 5/2025 is expected to reduce delays and confusion in practice. However, as with any regulatory change, successful implementation will depend on how consistently the new rules are applied on the ground. It is important for stakeholders to stay informed, engage with the relevant local Land Offices and Land Deed Official (Pejabat Pembuat Akta Tanah) when needed, and prepare for practical adjustments in land-related processes.`,

                article_background: `On 28 April 2025, Indonesian Financial Services Authority (_Otoritas Jasa Keuangan_  or “**OJK**”) enacted Regulation Number 9 of 2025 on the Dematerialization of Equity Securities and Management of Unclaimed Assets in the Capital Market (“**POJK 9/2025**”).

Historically, securities ownership in Indonesia has been in two forms: physical (scripted), which is recorded by the Share Registrar (_Biro Administrasi Efek_  or “**BAE**”), and electronic (scripless), which is managed electronically by the Indonesia Central Securities Depository (_Kustodian Sentral Efek Indonesia_  or “**KSEI**”). This results in decentralized recording and creates potential discrepancies between the two records and reflects gaps in the safeguards which supposed to ensure the data integrity.

The dematerialization process will impact unclaimed assets; particularly script securities in custodial account but have never been claimed by its owners. For a long time, custodians often face challenges from unpaid safekeeping fees and undisbursed dividend payments related to such dormant accounts.

In light of the foregoing, POJK 9/2025 aimed to mandate the conversion of all scripted securities to scripless form, establish a centralized, electronic ownership recording system, and introduces a legal framework to identify, classify, and manage unclaimed assets in Indonesian capital market.`,
                article_content: `New rules and/or key changes introduced under POJK 9/2025 are as follows:

-   **Mandatory Dematerialization of Securities**

All public companies are now required to issue equity and debt securities in scripless form, including multiple voting shares. As for existing scripted securities, the BAE or public companies that conduct their own securities administration, and the relevant securities holder must convert any scripted securities into scripless form within five years from 6 May 2025 being the effective date of POJK 9/2025 (“**Deadline**”). The POJK 9/2025 also outlines detailed procedures for dematerialization, including responsibilities of scripted securities holders, BAE and public companies.

Following the dematerialization, securities must be recorded in the collective custody, managed by KSEI or in the custodian accounts, managed by custodian banks or securities company.

-   **Communication & Disclosure Obligations**

BAE or public companies that conduct their own securities administration must (i) announce the dematerialization process and at least twice each year until the Deadline, and (ii) submit progress reports to OJK periodically every six months, with reporting dates of June 30 and December 31. Announcements must be made in both Bahasa Indonesia and English, and published through at least: the public company website, IDX website, OJK’s online platform, and registered mail to shareholders.

-   **Restrictions on Physical Share Transactions**

Upon Deadline, any transactions involving scripted securities will be prohibited, including transfer on exchange or off-exchange. Exceptions are made for specific cases such as transfers arising from inheritance, gifts, or court-ordered actions.

-   **Legal Framework for Unclaimed Assets**

POJK 9/2025 further introduces the legal mechanisms for identifying and managing unclaimed capital market assets. Unclaimed assets include:

-   Scripted securities not converted into scripless form after the Deadline

    The scripted securities owner can still claim ownership of unconverted securities within 5 (five) years after the Deadline. If no ownership claim is submitted within that period, BAE or the public company that administers its own securities must record these securities in the custodian accounts and submit a formal request to OJK to treat such securities as unclaimed assets.

-   Custodian accounts with no activity or funds for over five years

    Custodian must identify accounts with no activity or funds for over five years. Once identified, custodian shall send ownership confirmation request letters to the registered account holder at least twice a year over a five year period following the enactment of POJK 9/2025. If the holder either denies ownership or fails to respond within that period, the custodian must apply to OJK to have such assets declared as unclaimed assets. These unclaimed assets will then be transferred to and managed by a party appointed by OJK.

-   Other capital market assets with unverifiable ownership

    Parties engaging within the capital market sector may request OJK to designate certain assets, other than those previously described above, as unclaimed assets. The requesting party must prove that the asset is unclaimed, and that the owner cannot be identified or located by:

    -   confirming that the legal entity registered as the asset owner has been dissolved or has ceased conducting capital market activities; and/or
    -   sending a formal confirmation letter to the registered owner and receiving no response.

If OJK is satisfied with the supporting evidence, it may issue a formal determination declaring the asset as unclaimed.

In all cases, OJK is entitled to determine the party which will manage any unclaimed assets for a maximum of 30 years upon its determination, without the right to trade or dispose of them. Claimants (including heirs) may submit ownership claims during this period. If there is no claim after this 30-year period, OJK may request a court ruling to transfer these assets to a capital market industry development fund.

-   **Administrative Sanction**

POJK 9/2025 also imposes administrative sanctions on parties that fail to fulfil the aforementioned obligations, including BAE, public companies, custodians, parties declaring certain assets as unclaimed assets, and parties appointed by OJK to manage unclaimed assets. Such administrative sanctions may range from written warnings to the revocation of business licenses.`,
                article_conclusion: `POJK 9/2025 introduces a new comprehensive regulatory framework to modernize Indonesia’s capital market infrastructure. By mandating the full dematerialization of equity securities and establishing a structured regime for unclaimed asset management, the regulation seeks to enhance transparency, efficiency, and investor protection.

The regulation is expected to bring positive outcomes for investors. Holders of scripted share certificates will benefit from a five-year post-deadline window to claim and convert their scripted certificate, thereby easing administrative burdens and facilitating compliance.

The introduction of clear framework for unclaimed asset management also marks a significant step toward regulatory certainty and risk mitigation. By clearly outlining the identification, notification, and transfer processes, the regulation establishes a standardized and accountable framework for handling dormant or unclaimed assets.

For all public companies, BAE, custodians are encouraged to prepare a robust governance and monitoring system, essential to meet the regulatory requirements within the prescribed deadline. Proactive compliance will be critical to ensure that unclaimed assets are managed appropriately and avoid administrative sanctions.`,

                article_background: `On 11 December 2025, the Minister of Law of the Republic of Indonesia (“**MoL**”) issued Regulation No. 49 of 2025 on the Requirements and Procedures for the Establishment, Amendment and Dissolution of Limited Liability Company Legal Entities (“**MR 49/2025**”), which came into force on 17 December 2025. With its enactment, MR 49/2025 formally revokes and replaces the prior regulatory framework under MoL Regulation No. 21 of 2021 on the same subject matter (“**MR 21/2021**”).

MR 49/2025 is enacted to enhance the administration of legal entities within the Ministry of Law, particularly strengthening regulatory transparency, administrative order and accountability of business entities in Indonesia.

This update highlights the key changes introduced by MR 49/2025, offering practical guidance for stakeholders to navigate the new requirements and maintain compliance.`,
                article_content: `
-   **_New Requirement to File Shareholders Approval of Annual Report to the MoL_**

Under the previous regulatory framework, only amendments to a company’s articles of association and/or corporate data were required to be submitted to the MoL for approval and/or notification.

The preparation and internal approval of annual reports was largely treated as an internal corporate governance compliance matter, where external reporting is typically limited to public companies. MR 49/2025 introduces a significant change to this framework where it now mandates that the shareholders meeting, which approves the company’s annual report to be also drawn in a notarial deed and submitted (along with the annual report) to the MoL for receipt of notification within 30 calendar days from the shareholders meeting date. Failure to comply will result in administrative sanctions in the forms of a written warning and the blocking of access to the MoL’s Legal Entity Administration System (_Sistem Administrasi Badan Hukum_  or “**SABH**”).

This requirement applies to capital-partnership limited liability companies generally, regardless of whether the company is publicly listed or subject to sector-specific supervisory regimes, and does not apply to individual limited liability companies (_perseroan perorangan_).

-   **_New Required Beneficial Owner Information_**

MR 49/2025 imposes a stricter obligation on Indonesian companies with respect to the disclosure of beneficial owner information. Generally, MR 49/2025 is consistent with the existing regulatory frameworks, which require companies to disclose their beneficial ownership information to the MoL at the time of establishment and must promptly report any subsequent changes on the company’s beneficial owner. However, MR 49/2025 introduces a new mandatory requirement that companies must now also submit consent letter from the beneficial owner for the initial establishment of the company and for subsequent changes.

-   **_New Verification Requirement for Articles and Corporate Data Amendments_**

MR 49/2025 introduces a verification process for any applications relating to amendments to a company’s Articles of Association and/or corporate data. Under MR 49/2025, the MoL is now required to conduct a formal verification process prior to issuing its approval and/or issue receipt of notification of such amendments.

The Ministry of Law must complete this verification process within 14 working days from the date the application is formally received through the SABH. During this period, the Ministry of Law will ensure that the information entered in the digital form aligns with the uploaded supporting documents including the shareholders meeting, shares transfer deed, newspaper announcement (as applicable), and the company’s most recent data already recorded in the SABH. If any inconsistencies or legal deficiencies are identified, the application may be returned for clarification or rectification, in which case the notary must complete the required corrections within seven days of receiving the MoL’s comments.

-   **_Contingency for Non-Electronic Filings_**

MR 49/2025 introduces a contingency mechanism allowing for manual, non-electronic filings under certain technical circumstances. Specifically, notaries may file applications for the establishment, amendment or dissolution of companies offline if electronic filing is hindered by internet connectivity issues or where the SABH is temporarily unavailable or malfunctioning.

The detailed procedures for such manual filings are to be further regulated in a separate implementing regulation.

-   **_Transitional Provisions_**

To ensure legal certainty and continuity during the regulatory transition period, MR 49/2025 includes several key transitional provisions as follows:

1.  any applications for the establishment, amendment or dissolution of a legal entity submitted prior to 17 December 2025, will continue to be processed in accordance with MR 21/2021; and
2.  for companies that have not yet transitioned to the electronic system may continue to submit their financial statements manually for up to six months following 17 December 2025.`,
                article_conclusion: `The enactment of MR 49/2025 marks a material shift in the Indonesia’s corporate regulatory framework, most notably by elevating the approval of annual reports approval from an internal governance matter to  a formal state-supervised administrative obligation. Further, by mandating a strict 14-working-day verification period for corporate amendments, the Ministry of Law is enhancing transparency, data integrity, and proactive regulatory oversight.

To remain compliant and mitigate the risk of administrative sanctions, companies should update their internal governance and compliance procedures. It is essential to ensure that all future shareholders meeting approving annual reports are coordinated with a notary to produce the now-mandatory notarial deed for Ministry of Law filing. Furthermore, companies must factor the new 14 working day verification process period in their corporate action timelines, especially where amendments to articles of association and/or corporate data are conditions for a transaction.`,
